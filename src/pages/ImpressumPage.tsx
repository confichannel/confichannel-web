		<p><strong>Dispute resolution</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Liability for content</strong></p>
		<p>According to section 7, paragraph 1 TMG, as a service provider we are
			responsible for our own content on these pages according to the general
			laws. However, according to sections 8 through 10 TMG, we, as service
			providers, are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored external
			information or to conduct research into circumstances that point to
			illegal activity.</p>
		<p>Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with
			the general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this respect is
			only possible from the moment of knowledge of a concrete infringement. If
			we become aware of any violations of the law, we will immediately remove
			this content.</p>
		<p><strong>Liability for links</strong></p>
		<p>Our offering contains links to external websites of third parties on
			whose contents we have no influence. For this reason, we cannot accept any
			liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator
			of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages.
			The linked pages were checked for possible violations of the law at the
			time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of
			linking.</p>
		<p>However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not
			reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. If we become
			aware of any violations of the law, we will immediately remove such links.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Copyright law</strong></p>
		<p>The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are
			subject to German copyright law. The duplication, processing, distribution
			and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the
			written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies
			of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.</p>
		<p>Insofar as the content on this website has not been created by the
			operator, the copyright of third parties is observed. In particular,
			third-party content is identified as such. If you are aware of a copyright
			infringement, we ask for appropriate notice. We will immediately remove
			such content if we become aware of any infringements.</p>
		<p><strong>Objection to advertising mails</strong></p>
		<p>The use of contact data published in the context of the imprint
			obligation for the transmission of unsolicited advertising and information
			material is hereby rejected. The operators of the pages expressly reserve
			the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of
			advertising information, for example through spam e-mails.</p>
