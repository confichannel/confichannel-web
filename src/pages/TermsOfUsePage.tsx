					(henceforth ‘Modimido’, ‘we’, or ‘us’), Angermünder Straße 21, 12305
              Berlin.</li>
					<li>Deviations from these terms of use are only considered agreed upon
              if they have been expressly confirmed in writing by us.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Subject matter of the contract</strong><br />
        Through confichannel.com, Modimido offers a platform for sending
        messages between devices.
      </li>
			<li>
				<strong>Service description</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Anyone can, as users of our service, create and share channels.
						Subsequently, users can send encrypted messages through these
						channels and these messages are deleted from our servers after
						single retrieval.
					</li>
					<li>
						The ConfiChannel service can be accessed via a web browser with
						modern JavaScript enabled.&nbsp;We do our best to ensure that it
						works with the most common web browsers, which are freely available
						on a variety of devices.&nbsp;However, as these technologies are
						constantly changing, we cannot guarantee that they will work in all
						cases.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Test version</strong><br />
				ConfiChannel is currently offered as a test version;&nbsp;this is a
				version of software in active development that, despite our efforts, may
				have technical problems and performance problems.&nbsp;If you need a
				stable experience, please use a more established service.<br />
				If you encounter a technical problem with our software, please let us
				know and email us at&nbsp;bugs<span>@</span>confichannel.tech.
      </li>
			<li>
				<strong>User obligations</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Users are obligated to treat any information received from other
						users as confidential unless the source of the information
						explicitly states otherwise.&nbsp;This also applies after the
						termination of this contract.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users are obligated to comply with applicable legal requirements. In
						particular, users assure that content they upload to
						confichannel.com is free of third-party rights. Users release
						Modimido from third-party claims for content they upload.
					</li>
					<li>
						Any malicious activity and/or unauthorized activity and/or illegal
						activity and/or illegal content is strictly forbidden.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Conclusion of the contract</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The contract for the paid service between confichannel.com and
						users enters into force once users purchase a subscription. Access
						to paid services is activated upon receipt of the amount due.
					</li>
					<li>
						At the end of the period for which the user has paid, the free-tier
						limits enter into force.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Note on the right of revocation</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>
						As a consumer, you have the right to revoke this contract within
						fourteen days without giving any reason. The revocation period is
						fourteen days from the date of the contract entering into force. In
						order to exercise your right of revocation, you must inform us of
						your decision to revoke this contract by means of a clear
						declaration (e.g. a letter or e-mail sent by post).
					</li>
					<li>
						In order to respect the revocation period, it is sufficient that you
						send the notice of the exercise of the right of revocation before
						the expiry of the revocation period.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you revoke this contract, we will promptly refund all payments we
						have received from you no later than fourteen days from the date on
						which we received the notification of your revocation of this
						contract. For this refund, we will use the same method of payment
						that you used for the original transaction, unless you have
						expressly agreed with us otherwise; under no circumstances will you
						be charged fees for this repayment.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you have requested that the services be commenced during the
						period of cancellation, you must pay us a reasonable amount equal to
						the proportion of services, in comparison to the full service of the
						contract, already provided to you at the time you inform us that you
						are exercising the right of revocation with respect to this
						contract.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Payment for the service</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The prices at the time of payment are decisive. The prices are
						available on the purchase subscription page of the website.
					</li>
					<li>
						ConfiChannel reserves the right to adjust prices.&nbsp;ConfiChannel
						price adjustments will only take effect for future payments, so they
						will only affect new users and/or users opting-in to extend the
						duration of their contract.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Contract expiration/termination</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The contract ends at the end of the period chosen by users. The
						users&#8217; channels, however, remain in the system so that paid
						reactivation is possible at any time. Early termination is only
						possible if confichannel.com has a disruption in performance that
						precludes the use of channels to send messages.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users may come to the conclusion that they are not satisfied with
						the confichannel.com service within the first 30 days of a paid
						contract. If they do so, they can request a refund and they will be
						refunded the amount paid for their current contract.
					</li>
				</ol>
